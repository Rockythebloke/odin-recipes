<h1>Polish Sour Rye Soup (Żurek)</h1>
<img src="./Zurek.jpg" alt="Zurek jpg" height="600" width="600">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Żurek is an amazing Polish soup made with sausages, smoked meats, and rye sourdough starter. Sounds weird? I bet it does, but if only words could describe how delicious it is. It may be unusual to a foreign palate at first, but I can assure you, you will love it more and more with each bite (or spoon). The soup is meaty, smokey, thick, creamy, and delightfully sour. It’s traditionally eaten at Easter but is also popular during other parts of the year. I serve it with hard-boiled eggs and potatoes.
    While it sounds complicated it is actually quick and easy to make, you just need time to make the sour rye starter (5 days – this is only waiting time!). It just requires planning a few days in advance, that’s all!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sour rye starter (zakwas)</li>
    <li>Polish white sausage</li>
    <li>Smoked meats</li>
    <li>Broth</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Marjoram</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Cream</li>
    <li>Boiled Eggs</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    STEP 1: Cook the white sausage: Heat the broth, when hot add the raw white sausages and simmer over very low heat for 15-20 minutes (if you have already cooked sausage omit this step and just slice them like in step 2).
</p>
<p>
    STEP 2: Chop all the meats: Take the sausages out of the broth and cut them into slices. Cut the smoked sausage into 1/2-inch (1 cm) cubes and bacon into small cubes. Dice the onion, press the garlic through a garlic press, peel the potatoes, and cut them into 1-inch (2.5cm) chunks.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 3: Brown all the meats: heat the oil in a large frying pan. When hot, add all the chopped meat and sausages. Cook over high heat for a couple of minutes until nicely browned. Add all the meats to the pot with broth.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 4: Cook the onions, garlic, and marjoram: Add the onions to the pan and cook over medium heat for a couple of minutes or until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of marjoram and cook for 30-60 seconds more, until fragrant. Transfer the onions to the pot. Add a couple of tablespoons of broth to the pan and scrape with a spatula all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan (that’s where all the flavor is!), add them to the pot.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 5: Cook the potatoes: Add the potatoes to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 6: Add the sour rye starter. Stir the flour with the liquid and add to the soup (spices should be discarded). Make sure to add the starter gradually – trying the soup while you adding it, to make sure it’s not too sour for you (I always add the whole batch of my sour rye starter). Bring to a boil and simmer for a couple of minutes.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 7: Add the cream to the soup. Add the horseradish to your taste (I only added 1 teaspoon) – be careful when adding horseradish, it’s powerful and a little goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
    STEP 8: Season the soup with salt, pepper, and reserved 1 teaspoon of marjoram – rub the marjoram between your palms to release its aroma.
</p>
<p>Serve the soup with boiled eggs.</p>
