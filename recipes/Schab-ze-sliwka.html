<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This pork loin roast recipe is a traditional Polish dish often prepared for special occasions like Christmas (see our Polish Christmas Recipes) or Easter, but it’s also enjoyed on a daily basis. It’s called “Schab ze śliwką” which means pork loin with plums. It’s served warm as the main course or sliced thinly and served cold, for example, on open-faced sandwiches (kanapki). The cold version is commonly enjoyed for lunch or as part of a casual meal. I also like to take leftovers, cut them into bite-sized pieces, pan-fry them in butter until well-browned and crispy, and enjoy them with a green salad—it’s really, really good.
    What sets this recipe apart from other pork loin roast recipes is that the pork is stuffed with prunes, adding a unique sweetness that beautifully complements the savory flavors of the meat.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Boneless pork loin</li>
    <li>Dried prunes</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
    <li>Marjoram</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
    <li>Thyme</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    Prepare the Meat: remove the tendons from the pork loin but leave the fat on top intact.
    (3 pounds (1350g) boneless pork loin roast)
</p> 
<p>
    Cut the Pocket: Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a small slit through the middle of the roast lengthwise without cutting all the way through. This will create a pocket for the prunes.
</p>
<p>
    Season the meat: Generously season the pork with salt and pepper. Combine the spices and rub the meat thoroughly, making sure to coat it all over and inside the pocket.
    (1 tablespoon marjoram, 2 teaspoons paprika,1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 tablespoon table salt, please add to your taste but this is how much I used, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper)
</p>
<p>
    Stuff your roast: Fill the pocket with prunes (as many as will fit in the pocket), don’t try to add too many.
</p>
<p>
    Marinate Overnight: Place the seasoned and stuffed pork loin in a dish, cover, and refrigerate overnight.
    Note: Marinating the meat overnight is optional, but it really helps develop flavor and makes the meat more tender and juicy. I would strongly recommend marinating it at least 3-4 hours.
</p> 
<p>
    Prepare for Cooking: The next day, take the pork loin out of the fridge one hour before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
</p> 
<p>
    Sear the Meat: Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Briefly pan-fry the pork loin on all sides until browned.
</p> 
<p>
    Bake the Roast: Transfer the seared pork loin back to the baking dish and cover it with aluminum foil. Bake for 40 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C). You can take it out at 142°F (61°C) and it should come to the safe temperature while resting. (Note: Cooking time is roughly 20 minutes per pound.)
</p>
<p>
    Rest and Serve: Let the roast rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to redistribute. Slice into portions and serve.
    Enjoy!
